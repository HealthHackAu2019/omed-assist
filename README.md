# OMed Assist

This project was bootstrapped with [](https://github.com/surveyjs/surveyjs_react_quickstart),
which was in turn bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Prereqs

* node version 10.x (I'm using of v10.15.3)
* [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html)
* once you have the aws cli installed, you should run `aws configure`, which
    will prompt you for a key and secret (in Slack). Use the `ap-southeast-2`
    region.

## Running Locally

```
> npm run start
```
